Hello! 

This has been included to tell you what you need to know about this asset pack. Please read it thoroughly so you are informed.


HOW TO USE THE ASSETS
--------------------------------------
You can import these assets into your favourite engine(s) capable of loading 3D assets. There are three file formats you can choose from:
